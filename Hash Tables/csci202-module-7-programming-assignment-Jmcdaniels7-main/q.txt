Which hash table seems to find things faster? Do you notice a difference?
It looks like the second hash table would find things faster due to being organized 
in an array of linked lists.

Which hash table was easier to implement?
The standard array hash Table that does quadratic probing for collisions was easier to implement
mainly because I can understand it better.

Do you think changing the probing technique could help the first hash table?
Yes, we could try double hashing and it could help the first table.
